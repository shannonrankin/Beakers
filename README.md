Beaked whale acoustic events in the California Current Ecosystem recorded from drifting acoustic recorders.

Drifting acoustic recording buoys were deployed throughout the California Current during the 2016 PASCAL survey and the 2018 CCES survey. Echolocation clicks associated with beaked whales were detected using a series of PAMGuard click detectors, and beaked whale events were classified to species by a team of experienced acousticians. Please see cruise reports and publications for detailed methods.  These data include extracted wav files for a subset of these events.
